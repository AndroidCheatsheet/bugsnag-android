/**
 * migrate.h contains definitions of structs that were used in previous versions of a notifier
 * release.
 *
 * Because these structs are serialized to disk directly, we need to retain the original structs
 * whenever a field is added or changed.
 *
 * The bsg_report_header indicates what version was serialized to disk. Knowing this information,
 * it is possible to migrate old payloads by first serializing them into an old struct, and then
 * mapping them into the latest version of bugsnag_event.
