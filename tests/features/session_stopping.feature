Feature: Stopping and resuming sessions

Scenario: When a session is stopped the error has no session information
    When I run "StoppedSessionScenario"
    Then I wait to receive 3 requests
    #And I look at the requests
    And the request is valid for the session reporting API version "1.0" for the "Android Bugsnag Notifier" notifier
    And I discard the oldest request
    And the request is valid for the error reporting API version "4.0" for the "Android Bugsnag Notifier" notifier
    And the payload field "events.0.session" is not null
    And I discard the oldest request
    And the request is valid for the error reporting API version "4.0" for the "Android Bugsnag Notifier" notifier
    And the payload field "events.0.session" is null

Scenario: When a session is resumed the error uses the previous session information
    When I run "ResumedSessionScenario"
